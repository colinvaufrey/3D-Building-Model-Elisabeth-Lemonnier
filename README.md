# 3D Reproduction of building Ã‰lisabeth Lemonnier in INU Champollion

A 3D model created in Blender aimed at recreating the building where we take classes ; aimed at being included in a VR game as the setting.
My group and I were assigned this project the first week we started master AMINJ : it consisted of creating an educational VR game introducing the player to the classes and their aim.
